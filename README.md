Project Overview
This Git repository contains the source code for a Java project with the following modules:

m1-generics: This module deals with Java generics, allowing for the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of unspecified types.

m2-enum: This module focuses on Java enums, which are special data types that enable a variable to be a set of predefined constants.

m3-lambda: This module introduces lambda expressions in Java, enabling concise syntax for defining anonymous functions.

m4-double_colon_operator: This module explores the double colon (::) operator introduced in Java 8, which is used for method references.

m5-comparator_interface: This module covers the Comparator interface in Java, which provides a means for sorting collections of objects.

m6-stream: This module delves into Java streams, which provide a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.
